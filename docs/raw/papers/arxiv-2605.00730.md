## Abstract

The reconstruction of physically valid transport fields from subject-specific imaging data is a fundamental challenge in image-based computational modeling due to measurement noise, modeling uncertainties and discretization errors. Without a methodology to construct models that faithfully reflect the underlying physics, mechanistic understanding of complex biological systems is inherently limited. In this work, we address this challenge in the glymphatic system, the brain's waste-clearance network, where cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is transported through perivascular spaces into the brain parenchyma to facilitate metabolic waste removal. We introduce a computational framework for the high-fidelity reconstruction of subject-specific glymphatic transport fields from spatiotemporal imaging data. The formulation utilizes an advection-diffusion model with a velocity decomposition that imposes mass conservation, enabling the recovery of solenoidal (divergence-free) velocity fields through the solution of a constrained inverse problem. The system is discretized using immersed isogeometric analysis with quadratic B-spline basis functions, providing smooth, high-continuity solutions and inherent regularization of imaging noise. We demonstrate the framework's utility by using contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging of tracer transport in a mouse brain, obtaining spatially varying estimates of CSF velocity, diffusivity, and clearance parameters. Forward simulations using the recovered fields show close agreement with experimental observations, validating the framework's ability to characterize complex transport dynamics while preserving physical integrity. This approach provides a generalizable methodology for the robust inference of physically consistent transport fields from imperfect imaging data, with broad applicability to the image-guided modeling of biological and engineering systems.
