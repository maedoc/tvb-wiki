## Abstract

Epileptic seizures are neurological disorders characterized by abnormal and excessive electrical activity in the brain, resulting in recurrent seizure events. Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals are widely used for seizure diagnosis due to their ability to capture temporal and spatial neural dynamics. While recent deep learning methods have achieved high detection accuracy, they often lack interpretability and neurophysiological relevance. This study presents a frequency-aware framework for epileptic seizure detection based on ictal-phase EEG analysis. The raw EEG signals are decomposed into five frequency bands (delta, theta, alpha, lower beta, and higher beta), and eleven discriminative features are extracted from each band. A graph convolutional neural network (GCN) is then employed to model spatial dependencies among EEG electrodes, represented as graph nodes. Experiments on the CHB-MIT scalp EEG dataset demonstrate high detection performance, achieving accuracies of 97.1%, 97.13%, 99.5%, 99.7%, and 51.4% across the respective frequency bands, with an overall broadband accuracy of 99.01%. The results highlight the strong discriminative capability of mid-frequency bands and reveal frequency-specific seizure patterns. The proposed approach improves interpretability and diagnostic precision compared to conventional broadband EEG-based methods.
