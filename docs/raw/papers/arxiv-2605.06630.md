## Abstract

Safety-critical autonomy in adversarial settings demands more than Lyapunov stability of tracking error signals. An agent executing a goal-directed trajectory is intrinsically legible to a passive observer running online Bayesian inference, because the contractive dynamics of any Lyapunov basin of attraction concentrates posterior belief over the latent intent parameters. We initiates the study of intent privacy over a continuous state space as a joint control problem on the physical state combined with the latent belief state of a putative observer. With the main challenges concentrated around the analysis of the belief-state dynamics, the agent dynamics is assumed to be simple, modeled by the differential inclusion $\dot{x}\in u+\bar{d}\mathbb{B}$. That is, the agent is fully actuated with bounded unknown disturbance to the control input. The observer's intent inference process is modeled as a discrete-time stochastic dynamical system evolving over the belief state space of a Rao Blackwellized particle filter reasoning over large random samples of possible agent goals. The agent's control input is modeled as a piecewise constant signal, with jumps matching the RBPF update times. Building on a prior intent-inference framework and its KL-based information leakage measurement, a privacy constraint is imposed, which amounts to maintaining information leakage above a prescribed threshold with high probability, using probabilistic discrete-time control barrier functions. A key technical contribution is the derivation of separate PCBF results for the Bayesian update step and the resampling step of the RBPF, enabling a PCBF result for the full update as well as integration of the privacy constraint with the agent's task-side tracking requirement. Finally, a joint feasibility analysis is carried out by examining the interplay between the privacy constraint and the tracking envelope.
