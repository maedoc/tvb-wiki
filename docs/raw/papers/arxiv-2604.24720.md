## Abstract

Indonesian marketplace reviews mix standard vocabulary with slang, regional loanwords, numeric shorthands, and emoji, making lexicon-based sentiment tools unreliable in practice. This paper describes a two-track classification pipeline applied to the PRDECT-ID dataset, which contains 5,400 product reviews from 29 Indonesian e-commerce categories, each labeled for binary sentiment (Positive/Negative) and five-class emotion (Happy, Sad, Fear, Love, Anger). The first track applies TF-IDF vectorization with a PyCaret AutoML sweep across standard classifiers. The second track is a PyTorch Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) network with a shared encoder and two task-specific output heads. A preprocessing module applies 14 sequential cleaning steps, including a 140-entry slang dictionary assembled from marketplace corpora. Four configurations are benchmarked: BiLSTM Baseline, BiLSTM Improved, BiLSTM Large, and TextCNN. Training uses class-weighted cross-entropy loss, ReduceLROnPlateau scheduling, and early stopping. Both tracks are deployed as Gradio applications on Hugging Face Spaces. Source code is publicly available at https://github.com/ikii-sd/pba2026-crazyrichteam.
