## Abstract

Current audio deepfake detection has achieved remarkable performance using diverse deep learning architectures such as ResNet, and has seen further improvements with the introduction of large models (LMs) like Wav2Vec. The success of large language models (LLMs) further demonstrates the benefits of scaling model parameters, but also highlights one bottleneck where performance gains are constrained by parameter counts. Simply stacking additional layers, as done in current LLMs, is computationally expensive and requires full retraining. Furthermore, existing low-rank adaptation methods are primarily applied to attention-based architectures, which limits their scope. Inspired by the neuronal plasticity observed in mammalian brains, we propose novel algorithms, dropin and further plasticity, that dynamically adjust the number of neurons in certain layers to flexibly modulate model parameters. We evaluate these algorithms on multiple architectures, including ResNet, Gated Recurrent Neural Networks, and Wav2Vec. Experimental results using the widely recognised ASVSpoof2019 LA, PA, and FakeorReal dataset demonstrate consistent improvements in computational efficiency with the dropin approach and a maximum of around 39% and 66% relative reduction in Equal Error Rate with the dropin and plasticity approach among these dataset, respectively. The code and supplementary material are available at Github link.
