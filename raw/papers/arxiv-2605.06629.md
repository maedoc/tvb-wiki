## Abstract

Classical generative adversarial networks (GANs) have been applied to generate adversarial network traffic capable of attacking intrusion detection systems, but they suffer from shortcomings such as the need for large amounts of high-dimensional datasets, mode collapse, and high computational overhead. In this work, we propose a hybrid quantum-classical GAN (QC-GAN) framework where a variational quantum generator is used to generate synthetic network traffic flows mimicking malicious traffic using latent representations. Instead of sampling classical noise vectors, we encode the latent vector (the hidden features) as a quantum state, which is the basis for claiming more expressive latent representations and reducing computational overhead. A classical discriminator will be trained on real-world datasets (UNSW-NB15) and the proposed QC-GAN-generated fake network flows. In this configuration, the generator aims to minimize the discriminator's ability to distinguish real from fake traffic, while the discriminator aims to maximize its classification accuracy, in an iterative manner. In our attack model, we assume that the attacker is a state actor with access to limited quantum computing power, whereas the discriminator is chosen to be classical, as will likely be the case for most end users and organizations. We test the generated flows using classical intrusion detection system (IDS) models, such as a random forest classifier and a convolutional neural network-based classifier, for their ability to bypass the detection process. This work aims to highlight the possibilities of quantum machine learning as a means of generating advanced attack flows and stress testing classical IDS. Lastly, we further evaluate how hardware-based noise affects these attacks to offer a new perspective on IDS, highlighting the need for a quantum resilient defense system.
