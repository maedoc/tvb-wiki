## Abstract

Computer-use agents (CUAs) automate on-screen work, as illustrated by GPT-5.4 and Claude. Yet their reliability on complex, low-frequency interactions is still poor, limiting user trust. Our analysis of failure cases from advanced models suggests a long-tail pattern in GUI operations, where a relatively small fraction of complex and diverse interactions accounts for a disproportionate share of task failures. We hypothesize that this issue largely stems from the scarcity of data for complex interactions. To address this problem, we propose a new benchmark CUActSpot for evaluating models' capabilities on complex interactions across five modalities: GUI, text, table, canvas, and natural image, as well as a variety of actions (click, drag, draw, etc.), covering a broader range of interaction types than prior click-centric benchmarks that focus mainly on GUI widgets. We also design a renderer-based data-synthesis pipeline: scenes are automatically generated for each modality, screenshots and element coordinates are recorded, and an LLM produces matching instructions and action traces. After training on this corpus, our Phi-Ground-Any-4B outperforms open-source models with fewer than 32B parameters. We will release our benchmark, data, code, and models at https://github.com/microsoft/Phi-Ground.git
